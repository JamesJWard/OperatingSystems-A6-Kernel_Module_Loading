Assignment 6, Kernel Module Loading
Operating Systems Spring 2016

The objective of this assignment is to understand how modules get loaded into the kernel. Test.c is a simple module that prints "My first test module loaded! :)\n" when the module is loaded, and "Test module unloaded\n" when it is unloaded. The accompanying make file automates the process.
